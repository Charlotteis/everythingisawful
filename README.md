## Development

This is a [Middleman] application, which uses the [ruby] language. It uses [Sass] to write CSS.

1. `bundle install`
2. `middleman server`

When you start the `middleman server`, the app will be served at a local port.
Every time you make a change, the server will reload with the new changes.

* **TODO:** How does the site build
* **TODO:** How does the site deploy?
